# Simple-Image-Viewer
A simple, lightweight and minimal image viewer designed as an alternative to Windows 10 Photos.

Note: It’s actually really bad. It doesn’t have any of the edit features the default image gallery has. It only has next, back, open and show in folder. That’s it. No other stuff on it. I just hated the fact that in Windows Photos the back and next covers the bottom of the pic. Also annoyed by the share feature.
